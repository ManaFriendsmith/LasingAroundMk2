lasingaround-k2-advanced-assembler-can-laser-mill=Allow K2 advanced assembler to perform laser mill recipes
lasingaround-antiparticle-decelerator-flashing=Antiparticle decelerator flashing

[mod-setting-description]
lasingaround-allow-gubbins-in-mill=There are relatively few recipes in vanilla that strictly fit with the laser mill's flavor-function. This setting loosens the restriction and allows the laser mill to craft simple intermediates like copper wire.
lasingaround-allow-entities-in-mill=The laser mill can always create basic pipes (and steel pipes with Krastorio) regardless of this setting.
lasingaround-hide-duplicate-recipes=Laser mill recipe variants are identical to their assembler versions, save the need for helium. This setting hides these recipes from the handcrafting menu to reduce clutter. This does not hide recipes which can only be made in the laser mill. Recipes that have a laser mill variant will have an addendum to their description indicating this.
lasingaround-k2-advanced-assembler-can-laser-mill=This only applies to laser mill exclusive recipes like low density structures. The advanced assembler can never craft the exchange-helium-for-productivity versions of normal crafting recipes (the bonus productivity is attached to the laser mill entity itself, so the advanced assembler would be consuming helium for no benefit.)
lasingaround-antiparticle-decelerator-flashing=If enabled, the glow from the Antiparticle Decelerator will rapidly oscillate between magenta and blue, which may cause eyestrain or be dangerous for photosensitive players. If disabled, it will be solidly magenta. Note that the Antiparticle Decelerator only exists in the game when Space Age is enabled and difficulty is Maximal. Also note that due to the visual design of these machines, they will effectively flash rapidly regardless of this setting if boosted to high speeds with beacons/modules.\n[color=orange]LEAVE THIS OFF IF YOU ARE RUNNING A PUBLIC SERVER.[/color]
